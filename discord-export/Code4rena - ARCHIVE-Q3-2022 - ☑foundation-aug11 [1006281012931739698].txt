We did our testing in Hardhat but I set you up with a simple Forge test as well so you could use that to break things

Test files aren't important imo
Attackers don't care about  the tests, they look at ur etherscan

of course they don't matter in the end. but they can be helpful for some wardens poking around. ...are you saying that including a Goerli instance would be helpful for the contest?

they make POCs significantly easier. Also they ensure that you dont setup things incorrectly

Less time spent on PoC = more time spent on finding bugs = more bugs found (which is also the interest of the sponsor after all)

remappings.txt missing,  forge tests not running


[08/11/2022 8:58 PM] hardlydifficult
the remappings are inside the toml config. we tried this on a few machines and it ran. are you on the latest version?


[08/11/2022 8:58 PM] tofunmi
Haven't run foundryup in 4 to 5 days


[08/11/2022 8:58 PM] tofunmi
Thanks


[08/11/2022 8:59 PM] hardlydifficult
😆 didn't realize things were changing that quickly.  but did foundryup fix the problem for you?


[08/11/2022 8:59 PM] dravee
I can confirm that it'll run after a foundryup 😄 (please do say if it worked for you too)


[08/11/2022 9:00 PM] tofunmi
Nope 🥺


[08/11/2022 9:01 PM] hardlydifficult
hmm can you paste in the error?


[08/11/2022 9:02 PM] tofunmi
Unable to resolve  imports


[08/11/2022 9:03 PM] tofunmi
I would create a remappings file


[08/11/2022 9:03 PM] dravee
I had the same errors, had to run multiple rms (forge, cast and anvil) so that foundryup could reinstall them


[08/11/2022 9:03 PM] tofunmi
Even remove foundry and installed from the curl

{Reactions}
💯 

[08/11/2022 9:03 PM] dravee
Are you getting some error messages on foundryup?


[08/11/2022 9:03 PM] tofunmi
Yes


[08/11/2022 9:04 PM] dravee
For me it was that I had already "cargo installed forge, cast and anvil". I had to remove them so that the setup instructions don't show these messages. Then it went ok


[08/11/2022 9:05 PM] tofunmi
I removed home/user/foundry,  foundry's path completely


[08/11/2022 9:06 PM] dravee
This is what I had, do you have something similar? For once, the error message and mitigation were pretty clear ^^
```
foundryup: warning: it appears your system has already has forge installed via cargo. you may need to run 'rm /Users/dravee/.cargo/bin/forge' to allow foundryup to take precedence!
foundryup: warning: it appears your system has already has cast installed via cargo. you may need to run 'rm /Users/dravee/.cargo/bin/cast' to allow foundryup to take precedence!
foundryup: warning: it appears your system has already has anvil installed via cargo. you may need to run 'rm /Users/dravee/.cargo/bin/anvil' to allow foundryup to take precedence!

Nope

[08/11/2022 9:07 PM] dravee
I really had to run the 3 rms to correct the remappings error


[08/11/2022 9:08 PM] devtooligan
i got foundry tests to work.  one thing i had to do was add a line to foundry.toml `solc = "0.8.12"` because theres a bug in the latest version of foundry that wont allow compiling on 0.8.15


[08/11/2022 9:11 PM] hardlydifficult
I can't repo that either... just upgraded again to see... why is forge so inconsistent 😭

[08/11/2022 9:12 PM] hardlydifficult
hah that's probably the safest route


[08/11/2022 9:16 PM] hardlydifficult
could you try `forge config` and show us the `libs` array? i just did some testing and it seems the remappings we added are not needed, just the two libs in our toml


[08/11/2022 9:16 PM] tofunmi
Hmmm , there is no openzeppin contracts in the lib folder in the first place


[08/11/2022 9:16 PM] hardlydifficult
it's using node modules for oz


[08/11/2022 9:17 PM] hardlydifficult
this line in the toml makes it work nicely along side hardhat `libs = ['lib','node_modules']`


[08/11/2022 9:17 PM] tofunmi
Hate yarn install af , didn't do that


[08/11/2022 9:17 PM] hardlydifficult
ahhhhhh


[08/11/2022 9:18 PM] hardlydifficult
okay that'll do it


[08/11/2022 9:18 PM] tofunmi
Thought that since it was foundry


[08/11/2022 9:18 PM] hardlydifficult
i'll update the readme real quick to clarify that forge needs yarn too


[08/11/2022 9:19 PM] hardlydifficult
oh wait it's already in there -- but it's good to note in case others run into that as well

lots of good questions & concerns coming in. feel free to reach out! we're happy to clarify goals or how things are expected to work, and if you find an issue we might be able to help you confirm it & add some color for your submission

i'm not interested in getting a report that says no issues found. I'm here to learn and make the product better. So I'm happy to help you secure that High!

Is there an expectation that the NFTDropMarket will ever hold ETH? My assumption is no but want to double check.


[08/14/2022 4:05 PM] hardlydifficult
Correct, it shouldn’t hold any eth or other assets, it just facilities drop mint transactions

Newbie question 😅 : "contracts/mocks" is out of the scope? (for gas optimisations, if that's relevant)

{Reactions}

[08/14/2022 9:12 PM] hardlydifficult
That's right, out of scope. We're not trying to optimize tests here! ...although I am working on making them run faster for a better devEx next time around 😉


[08/14/2022 9:35 PM] hardlydifficult
Final day -- can't wait to see what you all have found. 

Again don't hesitate to DM any questions! 16 wardens have already reached out to me... if it might save you a few minutes of poking around, just ask

Thanks to everyone who participated! I'm excited to dive in, already started skimming over some of the submissions -- always something to learn here.

286 submissions; 34 submitted as high and 91 as medium. obviously these numbers will change a lot after we review & judge. so just a quick fyi on how it went 🙂

Hey Wardens 👋 
For anybody awarded in this contest, have you received your USDC or not yet?
I am wondering because I am worried I haven't configured MetaMask well.
I am pretty sure I imported the right USDC token, but it's showing that I have a 0 balance, and I can't see any transactions in the Polygon Blockchain explorer 🤔

Yes, and you must have received the USDC at the address: https://polygonscan.com/address/0x25e94b5304b9ee91c206480ff79fe779abbcf709#tokentxns

This is his wallet address.


[10/03/2022 6:54 AM] codingnamekiki
mb didn't see the part, where he mentioned his wallet address. If this is the problem, he probably didn't import the USDC right


[10/03/2022 6:57 AM] pfapostol
all wallet addresses are public information


[10/03/2022 6:59 AM] codingnamekiki
oh cool so there is leaderboard with every person and their address. Mind sending me the link?


[10/03/2022 7:02 AM] pfapostol
on code4rena github you can find information about each person and each contest. But this information does not relate to this particular contest, so it is better to use another channel for further discussion.
